# Business-Analysis

## Overview

An anonymous business has shared its sales data (2017-2019) on the website Kaggle. The goal of this project is to determine trends in the data. More specifically, the goal is to determine the following:

* Are sales increasing? 
* What products are selling the most?
* What products are selling the least? 
* What products produce the highest revenue per sale?
* Do higher discounts result in more products sold? What about total net sales? 

To answer these questions, Python and Jupyter Notebook were used, along with Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## Results

As the amount discounted is increased, the number of sales does in fact increase. As a result, discounts on products should be encouraged in moderation. 

## Conclusion
